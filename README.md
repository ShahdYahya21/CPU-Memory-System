## Verilog Code Overview  

### `CPU.v`  
- Implements a **basic CPU**.  
- Fetches, decodes, and executes instructions.  
- Contains an **ALU, control unit, and registers**.  

### `Memory.v`  
- Implements **memory storage**.  
- Supports **read and write** operations.  
- Interacts with the CPU for data access.  

These Verilog codes form the core of a simple CPU-memory system.
